    "- Decide on `DistributedEx()` within `Transducers` vs `Dagger.jl` vs `MPI.jl`  \n",
    "  ~~- Still reluctant on `MPI.jl` because it seems like it would require a lot of work to test various use cases would work well and require very careful considerations of how to move data around nodes etc.~~  \n",
    "  - If you do decide to stick with the `Transducers` ecosystem then [this section on containerization seems important](https://juliafolds.github.io/Transducers.jl/dev/tutorials/tutorial_parallel/#tutorial-parallel-collect). Important point is to use something like `init = Union{}[]` to initialize where the outputs of the `collect` will be stored.  \n",
    "  ~~- Having read a bit more about `Dagger.jl` I'm now leaning towards it, if I see any performance improvements over the hybrid of `Base.threads` + `Floops.ThreadedEx()`~~  \n",
    "  ~~- Having read even more and seeing only performance decrease with `Dagger.jl` for `compute_trials_nll` I'm leaning away from it. **Also, and more importantly, can't parallelize the grid search if you want to get trial posteriors** So there is no reason to implement grid_search_dagger versions as they can't offer the same functionality as other parallelization options.~~  \n",
    "  ~~- So is there any reason to run more benchmarks using Dagger for compute_trials_nll~~  \n",
    "    ~~- `grid_search_benchmarks_outputs` and `small_stepsize_recovery.ipynb` suggest opposing results for what is the best combination of `Floops` and `Base.threads`. So running everything one more time, with same resources, smaller stepsize, functions that are similar to each other in terms of output types and compared to serial might be useful to have as a comparison~~  \n",
    "    ~~- But stopped trying to debug any of the dagger functions. Added cautionary note to `dagger_benchmarks` directory. Moving onto comparing threads vs floops vs serial~~  \n",

    "  - Include a note on `MPI.jl` to the parallelization tutorial. One/those familiar with Dask can consider `Dagger.jl` especially for hierarchical/nested loop ability but at the time of writing these included too much overhead and were not as performant.  \n",
